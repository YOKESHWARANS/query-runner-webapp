# 🚀 SQL Query Viewer

SQL Query Viewer is a powerful web-based application designed for data analysts and developers to explore, execute, and visualize SQL queries interactively. With an intuitive UI and advanced visualization features, it enhances data exploration and performance monitoring.

## Problem Statement

- Data analysts and developers often struggle with exploring and visualizing SQL query results efficiently without setting up a full-fledged database. Existing tools are either too complex or lack intuitive visualization features, making data analysis cumbersome.

- The challenge is to build a lightweight, frontend-based SQL Query Viewer that enables users to:

- Execute predefined and custom SQL-like queries.

- Visualize query results in multiple formats (tables, charts, graphs).

- Track performance metrics such as query execution time and data size.

- Maintain query history for easy access and re-execution.

- Export query results in a structured format for further analysis.

- This project aims to bridge the gap between SQL query execution and user-friendly data visualization, enhancing productivity for data professionals.
